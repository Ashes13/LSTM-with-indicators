# LSTM-with-indicators
Changes that are made:
* LSTM predicts rise and fall of stock with sma indicator for next day and not every month, see intialize section in main.py
* LSTM is only trained at the begining of initialize with history of sma50, sm200 and close price 
* Backtest only occurs for one month(Jan 11 to Feb 11), to ensure predictions from lstm are only made for one month after training. 
  *LSTM will have to be retrained with the previous testing data(Jan to feb), if backtesting for the next month(march).
